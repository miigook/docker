Setup Steps:
-----------
1. Create the directory structure shown above
2. Create the necessary files with the provided code
3. Place the HTML content in the frontend/index.html file
4. Place the Node.js code in the appropriate backend files
5. Create a .env file with environment variables if needed
6. Build and run the Docker containers

Running the Application:
----------------------
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project
2. Run the following command to build and start all containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000
4. The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3000/api

Development Workflow:
-------------------
1. Make changes to the frontend files
2. Make changes to the backend files
3. Rebuild and restart the containers if necessary:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

Testing the API:
--------------
The following API endpoints are available:

Todos:
- GET /api/todos - Get all todos
- POST /api/todos - Create a new todo
- PATCH /api/todos/:id - Update a todo
- DELETE /api/todos/:id - Delete a todo

Notes:
- GET /api/notes - Get all notes
- POST /api/notes - Create a new note
- PATCH /api/notes/:id - Update a note
- DELETE /api/notes/:id - Delete a note

Weather:
- GET /api/weather?location=cityname - Get weather for a location

Stopping the Application:
-----------------------
To stop the containers, run:
```
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove volumes, run:
```
docker-compose down -v
```



Architecture Overview
This is a full-stack application with three main components:

Frontend: A single HTML page with CSS and JavaScript that provides a clean, responsive UI for managing todos, notes, and checking the weather.
Backend: A Node.js/Express server that handles API requests, interacts with the database, and makes calls to the weather.gov API.
Database: MongoDB for storing todos and notes.

Key Features

To-Do List: Create, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks
Notes: Create, edit, and delete notes with titles and content
Weather: Check the weather for US locations using the weather.gov API
Responsive Design: Looks good on all device sizes
Modern UI: Clean, card-based interface with subtle animations

Containerization Strategy
The application is split into three containers:

Frontend Container: Serves the static HTML/CSS/JS files using a lightweight Node.js server
Backend Container: Runs the Express API server
Database Container: Runs MongoDB

The Docker Compose file coordinates these containers, setting up the necessary networking and volumes.
Setup and Deployment

Create the file structure as shown in the "Project Structure" artifact
Copy the code from each artifact into the appropriate files
From the project root directory, run docker-compose up -d
Access the application at http://localhost:5000

Additional Notes

The weather API integration uses a simplified approach. For a production application, you'd want to implement proper geocoding for addresses.
There's volume mapping in the Docker Compose file to enable hot-reloading during development.
The MongoDB data is persisted in a Docker volume.
